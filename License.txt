=======================================================

VRAGE, Miner Wars™, Miner Wars 2081™, Miner Wars MMO™, Miner Wars Arena™ are trademarks of Keen Software House a. s. 
Copyright © 2008-2013 Keen Software House a. s. 

This source code and art assets must not to be mistaken for free software, an open source in a free-software 
activist understanding, copy-left or public domain software. All source code and art assets remain copyrighted 
and licensed by Keen Software House a. s. and you are allowed to use them (modify, tweak, make a derivative work, 
distribute, etc.) only under following conditions.

You are not allowed to distribute original art assets (textures, models, fonts, etc. stored in Content folder of 
Miner Wars 2081 folder). The only exception is sounds and music, which can be distributed if your mod requires it 
(this is because our XACT audio project requires all sound and music files when building and without our original 
files you won’t be able to make audio modifications).

The source code, modifications or derivative works can be distributed only if they are intended to be used as a 
mod for Miner Wars 2081, and only if valid customers would be able to use them. You are not allowed to bypass 
this restriction and create a standalone application or use our code in your projects.

In other words, everyone who wants to develop and/or use mods based on this source code is required to own 
valid Steam version of Miner Wars 2081. You are not allowed to use this source code in an application other 
than Miner Wars 2081.

This source release does not contain any game data (except audio). The game data is still covered by the original
license and must be obeyed as usual. 
Miner Wars 2081 is available from the Steam store at http://store.steampowered.com/app/223430/

You are allowed to share the source files with other developers (crediting us when logical/reasonable), 
downloading and compiling the game locally, modifying and tweaking the game locally, and even publicly forking, 
modifying, and tweaking the game source on GitHub.
The origin of this software must not be misrepresented; you must not claim that you wrote the original software. 

Altered source versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be misrepresented as being the original software. 
This notice may not be removed or altered from any source distribution. Commercial usage is allowed only after you
obtain an agreement from us (Keen Software House a.s.). Send us an email: info@keenswh.com

That's it! No more rules. If the above wasn't clear, here's a summary: use this source code only for developing 
mods for Miner Wars 2081. Mod is a DLL that's launched by valid and purchased Miner Wars 2081 (distributed by Steam).

We reserve the right to change this license at any time with or without notice, with immediate and/or retroactive 
effect. We believe that what we ask is reasonable, so please don't try to bypass it. Miner Wars 2081 still pays our 
monthly bills and without this income we wouldn't be able to finish our next project. We're trying to be open and 
honest, and we hope people treat us the same way back. Basically, don't be ridiculous and we won't. 

This software is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied warranty. In no event will the authors be held 
liable for any damages arising from the use of this software.

Don’t be afraid to experiment with the source code. If you break something, you can always revert by downloading it 
again. 

If there's anything legal you're wondering about that isn't answered from this page, don't do it and ask us about it. 
If there's anything you don't understand or you consider confusing, please email us your suggestions: info@keenswh.com

Thank you and have fun!
